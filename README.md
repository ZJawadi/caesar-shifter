# caesar-shifter

This is a basic encrypter/decrypter that uses the Caesar Cipher, which is a subtitue cipher that shifts letters based on an inputter integer. For example, if the key was 5, the letter 'A' would be shifted by 5 letters into an 'F', 'B' would become 'G' and so on. In this code, text can be entered in the originalText.txt file; this is the text that will be shifted depending on the key. The user can choose by how much they want to shift and whether they would like to encrypt or decrypt the originalText, and the output will be printed in the appropriate text file. The alphabet used to determine the shift may also be changed by the user if they so wish by modifying the alphabet.txt file. I coded this in high school as a project, and it was one of my first larger ones that had no assisstance from my teacher.
